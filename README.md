This is a from-scratch implementation of 5 very popular data structures:
<ul>
  <li>
    AVL Tree
  </li>
  <li>
    Binary Search Tree
  </li>
  <li>
    HashTable
  </li>

    Sorted Array and 
  </li>
  <li>
    Unsorted Array
  </li>
</ul>

These data structures were developed as part of a <b>Data Structures</b> course project. They are compared in terms of their performance when storing and retrieving word pairs from a large text file.
